2. Make the entity-relationship diagram (ERD).
3. Starting from the entity-relationship diagram, make the conceptual diagram of the proposed model, integrating all the necessary attributes.
4. Implement the realized conceptual diagram in Oracle: define all the tables, implementing all the necessary integrity constraints (primary keys, external keys, etc.).
5. Add consistent information to the tables created (minimum 3-5 records for each independent entity; minimum 10 records for the associative table).
6. Define a stored subroutine that uses a studied collection type. Call the subroutine.
7. Define a stored subroutine that uses a studied cursor type. Call the subroutine.
8. Define a stored function subprogram that uses 3 of the defined tables. Treat all exceptions that may occur. Call the subprogram so that all the cases treated are highlighted.
9. Define a stored procedure subprogram that uses 5 of the defined tables. Treat all exceptions that may occur. Call the subprogram so that all the cases treated are highlighted.
10. Define a LMD trigger at the command level. Trigger the trigger.
11. Define a line level LMD trigger. 
12. Define a LDD trigger. 
13. Define a package that contains all the objects defined in the project.
14. Define a package that includes complex data types and objects required for integrated actions.
